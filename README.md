Heterogeneity, Attacks, and Robustness in Federated Learning

This repository contains a Streamlit-based interactive application named **Harfed**, dedicated to configuring and running Federated Learning (FL) experiments with detailed visualization and monitoring. The app features an intuitive UI with comprehensive visualizations and real-time monitoring capabilities. It has been utilized in the research and experiments presented in our published paper: [Exploring Heterogeneity, Attacks, and Robustness in Federated Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857574).

## Overview

The Harfed application provides a streamlined interface for setting up and conducting Federated Learning experiments, particularly focusing on:
1. **Heterogeneous data distributions**: Support for advanced dataset partitioning strategies like Dirichlet and Pathological.
2. **Robustness testing**: Configuring experiments with malfunctions or adversarial behavior (e.g., targeted or untargeted attacks).
3. **Monitoring and visualization**: GPU utilization tracking, dataset partition visualizations, accuracy trends, and attack success rates over training rounds.
